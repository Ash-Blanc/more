## üéØ Vision Statement

Video generation AI faces critical bottlenecks in computational efficiency and scalability. This research explores how the revolutionary **Mixture of Recursions (MoR)** architecture can be synergistically combined with **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** to dramatically reduce costs and improve quality in **Diffusion Transformer** video models.

**Our Hypothesis**: By routing video tokens through specialized experts and then applying adaptive recursive processing, we can achieve unprecedented efficiency gains while maintaining or improving generation quality.

## üî¨ Research Problem

Current video generation models face several critical challenges:

- **Massive Computational Cost**: Training and inference require enormous GPU resources
- **Memory Bottlenecks**: Long video sequences strain transformer memory limits
- **Quality vs Speed Trade-offs**: Higher quality often means exponentially higher costs
- **Inefficient Token Processing**: All tokens receive equal computation regardless of complexity

## üß† Proposed Solution: Hybrid MoE-MoR Architecture

### Core Innovation
We propose a two-stage hybrid approach:

1. **Stage 1 - Expert Routing (MoE)**: Route video tokens to specialized experts based on content type
   - **Temporal Expert**: Frame-to-frame consistency and motion dynamics
   - **Spatial Expert**: Fine-grained visual details and textures
   - **Motion Expert**: Complex movement patterns and object interactions
   - **Context Expert**: Long-range video coherence and scene understanding

2. **Stage 2 - Adaptive Recursion (MoR)**: Each expert's output undergoes token-level recursive processing
   - Simple tokens: Exit early (1-2 recursion steps)
   - Complex tokens: Deep processing (3-8+ recursion steps)
   - Shared parameter stack for efficiency

### Target Architecture: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)

Our focus is on Diffusion Transformer architectures that operate on spacetime patches of video and image latent codes, as pioneered by OpenAI's Sora. DiT models, developed by William Peebles and Saining Xie, use the idea of diffusion for predicting videos and the strength of transformers for next-level scaling.

## üìä Expected Impact

Based on individual MoE and MoR benchmarks, our hybrid approach targets:

| Metric | Current DiT Models | MoRE Target | Potential Gain |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|
| Training Cost | 100% | 10-25% | **75-90% ‚Üì** |
| Inference Speed | 1x | 2-4x | **2-4x ‚Üë** |
| Memory Usage | 100% | 40-60% | **40-60% ‚Üì** |
| Video Quality | Baseline | 20-40% better | **20-40% ‚Üë** |
